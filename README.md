# hello-world
first repository ever! 

Hey!  greetings human, I'm learning how to use github and I hope that this site becomes useful to my work.  I'm salvadorean and currently live in El Salvador, and although its reputation is not very good our people are hard working and intelligent individuals, warm and caring compared to the individualistic societies of first world countries.  Corruption in politics and disproportionate allocation of wealth is a day to day reality we live in our country, but we strive to fight! and with God's help as well we will make a difference.


this is the version 2 edit of hello-world
